# Verilog Calculator

This is a collaborative project between Maksim Repko and Russell Gladis.

Function: This project utilizes the Verilog langauage in order to run a calculator. This calculator has a variety of functions, ranging from simple addition to complex multiplication and division oprations. The code was tested and ran on a Xilinx FPGA using Xilinx software.

How it works: The calculator uses inputs in the form of bits, rather than whole numbers, and manipluates the inputs using Gate Logic rather than just running just outright adding as one might with high-level languages. The inputs are set using the physical switches on the FPGA and output the results onto the 7-segment displays on the same device.
